## About me

I call myself Tech and Cyber Security enthusiast, tinkering with technologies and security focused mindset from my childhood.

My passion in tech and security led me to develop my skills for cybersecurity, focusing on purple teaming. I am now forseeing to apply the skills I gained through different challanges and CTF's in the real world to protect assets of companies and industries from threats, specifically focused to join as a Security Engineer, SOC or DFIR.


## Objective

techniques with defensive strategies to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen system defences. I have hands-on 
experience in security engineering and SOC operations including log analysis, system hardening, SIEM 
monitoring. Specializing in web application security and continuously enhancing my skills through learning and 
practical labs. Enthusiastic about proactive defence and threat detection I am committed to delivering practical and 
effective security solutions.
